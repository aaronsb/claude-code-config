# Documentation

Map of the documentation tree. For the project overview, see the [main README](../README.md).

## Where to find what

| Path | What's there |
|------|-------------|
| [hooks-and-ways/README.md](hooks-and-ways/README.md) | **Start here** — how the system works, reading paths by role |
| [hooks-and-ways/](hooks-and-ways/) | Guides: creating ways, matching, macros, provenance, teams |
| [hooks-and-ways.md](hooks-and-ways.md) | Reference: hook lifecycle, state management, session gating |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | System architecture diagrams (Mermaid) |
| [architecture/](architecture/) | Architecture Decision Records (managed by `docs/scripts/adr`) |

## Guides vs Reference

Two things named `hooks-and-ways` — they serve different layers:

- **`hooks-and-ways/`** (directory) — guides for practitioners. "How do I create a way?" "How does matching work?"
- **`hooks-and-ways.md`** (file) — reference for contributors. Hook lifecycle, state diagrams, internal mechanics.

## Governance

|------|-------------|
| [../governance/README.md](../governance/README.md) | Governance traceability — provenance chain, reporting tools |
| [hooks-and-ways/provenance.md](hooks-and-ways/provenance.md) | Adding provenance to your ways |
