# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Claude Code Configuration.
Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision, its context, and consequences.

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow a consistent format:
- **Status:** Draft / Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Date:** When the decision was made
- **Deciders:** Who made the decision
- **Context:** The problem or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision:** The architectural choice made
- **Consequences:** Benefits, drawbacks, and other impacts
